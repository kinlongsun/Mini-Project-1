Suggested structure for DSC CP Final Reports

I recommend that you structure your CP final report
documents according to the following sections,
which align with the specification of the "Final paper"
in the "Capstone Project Guidelines" document (CPGD),
available from section 2.3.1 of our curriculum.

You can find this information on page 12 of the
CPGD--"Step 8" (October 3rd 2018 edition).

(0) Cover Page:

- "Springboard--DSC"
- "Capstone Project X" (X = 1,2)
- [CP Title]
- "By" [Author]
- [Month], [Year]

(1) Introduction:

Briefly define the problem, intended stakeholders,
and data science results (very briefly).

Think of this section as the "Executive Summary"
of your report.

Make sure to mention that implementation
details can be found in the notebooks you
developed, and include a link to the root
folder in your GitHub repository that contains
all your project deliverables.

Therefore, you do not need to inclue Python
code in this report--unless you implemented
some remarkable algorithm!

(2) Approach

(2.1) Data Acquisition and Wrangling

Describe what you did to get the raw
datasets you used, and how you got them
ready for further analysis.

(2.2) Storytelling and Inferential Statistics

Show a small subset of your data story, and of
of your applications of inferential statistics,
including associated visualizations and 
appropriate commentaries.

(2.3) Baseline Modeling

Discuss the model/s you chose to build a baseline,
including a summary of the obtained results. 
Leave the comparative analysis for section (3).

(2.4) Extended Modeling

Discuss what motivated the implementation of 
other models, hopefully more advanced, including 
a summary of the obtained results. Leave the 
comparative analysis for section (3). 

(3) Findings

Present a summary of all your results in
a table like the following:


		PM1	PM2	PM3 ...
------------------------------------------------
Model 1		X	X	X
------------------------------------------------
Model 2		X 	X	X
------------------------------------------------
Model 3		X	X	X
...


Where 'PM' stands for 'Performance Metric'.

Present a discussion of these results with two
goals in mind:

* To highlight the relative merits (or lack thereof)
of each model. Including, if appropriate, the
identification of the "best model".

* To connect this analysis with the original
business problem. In other words, to discuss
the implications of these results in the context
of the original business problem.


(4) Conclusions and Future Work

Your conclusions tie together the original
business problem, the data science problems
you decided to model the former with, and the
results you obtained.

Future work can be presented as a bulleted
list of approaches you would like to have tried
given more time (and resources--when applicable).

(5) Recommendations for the Clients

From the CPGD, it is required that you
offer "up to 3 concrete recommendations on how 
your client[s] can use your findings."

This is the way to "close the loop" between
the original business problem, the data
science problems you decided to pursue, and
the results you obtained.

In "real-life" projects, this is where us data
scientists communicate the results to our clients
in a way that they suggest (or prescribe, in some
cases) concrete business interventions.

I would recommend that you present your recommendations
as a bulleted list.

(6) Consulted Resources

This is just a list of articles, packages,
books, and any other resource you used in
this project.
